âœ… AI Agent Integration - JRW Portal (Vercel + OpenAI)

1. Add your OpenAI key to a .env.local file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

2. The agent lives at:
   /pages/api/agent.js

3. Access the chat interface at:
   /agent-chat

4. You can ask questions like:
   - "Why did my sales drop last quarter?"
   - "Explain what RMSE means in my dashboard."
   - "How do I improve my forecast accuracy?"

Deploy this project to Vercel. The serverless function runs securely there and uses your private API key.
