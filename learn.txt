Other functions
These are special functions that cannot be classified in other categories.

Parent-child functions
These functions help flatten a parent-child hierarchy into a regular hierarchy.

Relationship management functions
These functions manage and manipulate relationships between tables.

Statistical functions
Statistical aggregation functions.

Table manipulation functions
These functions manipulate and return tables.

Text functions
Text functions manipulate strings.

Time Intelligence functions
Time intelligence functions support calculations to compare and aggregate data over time periods, supporting days, months, quarters, and years.

Visual calculations functions
Visual calculations functions can only be used in Power BI visual calculations and cannot be used in regular measures, calculated columns, nor calculated tables.
